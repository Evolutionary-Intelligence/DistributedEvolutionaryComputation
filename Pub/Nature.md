  * "To verify configuration diversity, we performed a structure search of diamond {112} ITB with an evolutionary algorithm and estimated excess energy with first-principles calculations."
  * "The structure search of diamond {112} ITB was performed using our structure search code based on the evolutionary algorithm. In this process, the algorithm samples a diverse population of different configurations and improves them over many generations on the basis of the selection criterion. Excess energy was used as the principal selection criterion (see next section for calculation details). For ITB configurations, because the crossover operation of multiple parents usually produces a high-energy configuration, all child configurations were generated from a single parent via mutation in our search. The evolutionary search evolved 44 generations at 0 K. Following the search, clustering analysis was performed using the k-medoids algorithm to cluster distinct ITB configurations."

Specifically, we performed seven flights in which we made a high-frequency log of all onboard sensor data. This allowed to run the EKF offline on the data sets. Then, CMA-ES optimized the parameters of the EKF, with as cost function the sum of squared errors of the estimates (comparing EKF estimates with the logged ‘ground truth’ from the complementary filter for attitude and motion-tracking system for height and velocities)."

  * "To fit a Keplerien solution to our data, we use a genetic algorithm to retrieve multiple Keplerian orbital solutions. The main advantage of genetic algorithm compared to other advanced methods such as “Markov chain Monte Carlo” (MCMC) with parallel tempering is that it allows probing the full model parameters space in an extremely efficient way. However, the population at the end of the evolution is not statistically reliable owing the intrinsic nature of genetic algorithm based on genome crossover and mutation. We therefore add a MCMC module with Metropolis hasting to overcome this problem."

Fitter solutions are then combined to create a next-generation algorithm that benefits from their superior elements. The idea is to ultimately ‘evolve’ an optimal solution."
